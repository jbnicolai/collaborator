collaborator
============

Use require-js as  DIC to provide collaborators for your jasmine specs.

Edit the file collaborators.js to provide a definition of your tests collaborators.
Specify the names of the collaborators methods explicitly, and a jasmine spy will be created for them.
If you use 'null' for the method names, an existing module will be expected to be found in the src/ directory.

More examples will be available shortly.
